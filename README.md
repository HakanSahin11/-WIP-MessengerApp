# WIP MessengerApp
Initial try at building a messenger application, which were postponed due to school work at the given time.
The application is separated into two main areas, front and backend, which both revolves around C#.

The Frontend is made using WPF and stands for the UI which includes user login, creation, mainpage and chatting with people on their friendlist.
The Backend is made of a C# API which utilizes the NoSQL database MongoDB for storage of sensitive userinfos and chatlogs amongs the users.
